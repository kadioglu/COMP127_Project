# COMP 127 Final Project: Hangman
Joseph &amp; Lizbet's final project for COMP 127: Hangman Game

In Hangman, you have to guess a word with a limited number of guesses. The mystery word is represented by a series of dashes ("-"). 

The goal of the game is to guess the word without using all of the guesses. If one runs out of guesses, it's game over.

How to play:

* Open the Hangman Class
* On the console, the mystery word will appear, written by dashes. The number of guesses you have will also appear. 
* A blank canvas will appear, this is where the hangman figure will appear as you enter incorrect guesses
* Enter a letter in the console. If the letter is in the word, it will replace the dash at the proper location. Else, it will reduce your guesses left and update the canvas.
* The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
* You have to chance to play again when you enter 'y' when prompted. Otherwise, it would just exit the game.

Thanks for playing our Hangman Game!
