# COMP 127 Final Project: Hangman
Joseph &amp; Lizbet's final project for COMP 127: Hangman Game

In Hangman, you have to guess a word with a limited number of guesses. The mystery word is represented by a series of dashes ("-"). 

The goal of the game is to guess the word without using all of the guesses. If one runs out of guesses, it's game over.
